                  >3 years ago I was a senior in College and every day I woke up
                  and told myself "Live it up Mike, because this is the last of
                  it." I was convinced that College was my last opportunity to
                  learn, explore life and actually have FUN on a daily basis
                  before the boring reality of the real-world took over.
                  <br /><br />For a while I was right. I found myself at a
                  mind-numbing day job, surrounded by people who wore suits
                  every day, were just like me and showed no inclination of
                  innovation. This was it, this was the real world... this
                  SUCKED!<br />
                  <br />Then I stumbled upon AppNexus. This may sound overly
                  evangelical, but this company enlightened me. It poured life
                  into my metaporical roots and mannn did I suck that life in.
                  From the nerf-guns, to the yoyo's, to the casual drinking at
                  work, to actually being friends with the people you work with,
                  I was blown away. I entered the doors as a non-technical,
                  fresh-faced post-graduate and am now leaving as a technical
                  (at least kind of #Fullstack @sharif), introspective
                  professional. The people I have met here have touched my
                  heart. It's sometimes weird to use the word "love" in a work
                  setting... but I love all of my fellow AppNexians. I've
                  learned so much from you, I've experienced so much from you,
                  you are the fertiliizer that has grown me into the big lanky
                  tree that I am today. <br /><br />A lot of things have changed
                  since I joined this company but the people have stayed the
                  same (other than the 78.4% avg annual turnover rate). I hope
                  to see each and everyone one of you again in the future.
